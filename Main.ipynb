    "\n",
    "The user interface (UI) functions by implementing code written with ActiveCampaign's API features to export data from iConsultancy ActiveCampaign Deals, which iConsultancy uses to store information on potential project leads and current semester projects. Each button of the UI can be manipulated interactively, where a function will be called based by the criteria chosen, resulting in specified data for output. Based on the input criteria selected by the user, the UI will create queries to extract the data from iConsultancy's ActiveCampaign Deals pipeline and output the data into a comma-separated value (.CSV) fileformat. This will allow iConsultancy user's the ability to keep track of the information and the current state of a project charter efficiently. With the UI, user's will also be able to extract data at any time.\n",
